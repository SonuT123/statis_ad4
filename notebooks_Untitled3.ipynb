Calculate the confidence interval:\n\n\n             Confidence interval = 68 inches ± 0.3 inches\n\n\n\n            Confidence interval = 67.7 inches to 68.3 inches\n\n\n          Therefore, we can be 95% confident that the true average height of all adults in the United\n                    States is between 67.7 inches and 68.3 inches.\n\n        As you can see, the margin of error in the confidence interval is smaller when the sample size is larger.\n           This is because a larger sample size provides more information about the population,\n            and therefore allows us to make more accurate estimates of the population parameters.\n\n       In general, it is always a good idea to use as large of a sample size as possible when conducting research.\n           This will help to ensure that your results are accurate and reliable.\n        \n        ",
